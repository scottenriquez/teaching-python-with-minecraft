# Teaching Python with Minecraft
Forked from [fogleman/Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft), this project is designed to teach novices the basics of programming. The license for that project has been included here.

# Lesson 1: Using the Command Line
A terminal is alternative way of giving the computer commands. You're probably used to interacting with the computer via the GUI (graphical user interface), but sometimes it's easier to type commands. While every operating system has a built-in terminal, I recommend using [cmder](http://cmder.net/) for Windows and [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for macOS.

Start by typing <code>pip install pyglet</code> into the command line and press enter. This will install a dependency called Pyglet which is used to create the game visualization. Note that you only need to execute this command once.

After this, you can run the game using the command <code>python main.py</code>. To quit the game, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
